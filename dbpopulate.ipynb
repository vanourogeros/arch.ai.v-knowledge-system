Air conditioner (AC) sales are booming worldwide, especially in emerging economies such as China, India and Indonesia where rising incomes make them more affordable and a warmer, more humid climate a necessity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling\">predicts that around two thirds</a> of the world&rsquo;s households could have an AC by 2050, and the demand for energy to cool buildings could triple.</p>\\n<p>Keeping buildings cool contributes to global warming in two ways: ACs run on electricity, and they can release chemicals with a strong heat-trapping effect. ACs account for <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/cooling&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/cooling\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/cooling\">16 percent of total electricity</a> used in residential and commercial buildings around the world. This is significantly less than emissions caused by heating buildings&mdash;heaters run on natural gas, oil or electricity. But since the 2000s demand for air conditioning, ventilation and refrigeration systems has grown twice as fast as that for heating systems, at an average four percent per year.</p>\\n<p>Globally, there are around two billion AC units in use today&mdash;with the United States, Japan and China accounting for two thirds of them. China produces about 70 per cent of the world&rsquo;s air conditioners and has experienced exceptionally growing demand in the last twenty years; around four in ten air conditioners are purchased and installed in the country.</p>\\n<p>The units precisely control the temperature and humidity in shops, laboratories or server rooms. They ensure that people feel as comfortable on a transatlantic flight as they do at home, using more electricity than any home appliance. But all that comes at a cost, and unless we switch to fully renewable electricity, the boom in air conditioning will generate more emissions and contribute to global warming, making hot summers even hotter.</p>\\n<p>With every new AC installed, the risk of a leak increases. The technology behind modern ACs hasn&rsquo;t changed significantly since 1902, when a 25-year-old engineer named Willis Carrier invented a mechanical unit to control the temperature and humidity in a printing plant in New York. Carrier&rsquo;s unit sent air through coils filled with cold water, and cooled the air while removing moisture from the room. His invention was soon fitted in other buildings, mainly in the textile, film and food industries, and a few decades later in people&rsquo;s homes.</p>\\n<p>Today, the coils are filled with a refrigerant, a cold substance that easily changes from liquid to gas because of its low boiling point. As warm air from a room passes over the evaporator coils, the refrigerant absorbs the ambient heat, evaporates and carries away the heat through a condenser unit that sits outside a building.</p>\\n<p>These refrigerants are useful but problematic. They can seep out through joints, cracks or holes in the piping and contribute to global warming. The leakage of so-called fluorinated gases was particularly high by 2014&mdash;it accounted for about three <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/ims/hydrofluorocarbon-phase-down-in-europe\">percent of all greenhouse gas emissions</a> in Europe&mdash;so the EU adopted a law to cap the amounts of gases sold. The conventional refrigerant R-410A is still widely used worldwide and has the potential to trap thousands of times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.</p>\\n<p>While there are climate-friendlier AC units available on the market, most consumers purchase models that are cheaper and less efficient. In 2018, the Rocky Mountain Institute&mdash;a U.S. think tank focused on energy policy&mdash;offered a $1 million prize for residential cooling solutions that have a <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://globalcoolingprize.org/prize-details/criteria/&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://globalcoolingprize.org/prize-details/criteria/\" href=\"https://globalcoolingprize.org/prize-details/criteria/\">five times lower climate impact than a standard air conditioner, at no more than twice the cost</a>. The prize, announced in April this year, went to two of the world&rsquo;s largest manufacturers, Daikin and Gree. Their prototypes fundamentally work like existing ACs, but use refrigerants with lower global warming potential and are able to switch between operating modes depending on the outside weather conditions. Gree has also attached a small solar panel to its outdoor unit to generate some of the electricity needed to operate the AC.</p>\\n<p>But other companies want to ditch gaseous refrigerants altogether and replace them with materials that absorb heat just as well without the risk of leakage or fire. Barocal, a spin-off from the University of Cambridge, was one of the eight finalists in the competition. The team behind it, led by material scientist Xavier Moya, investigated whether <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb0973\">solid materials</a> could efficiently cool air. It settled on plastic crystals to generate an effect known as barocaloric cooling: the crystals are flexible so when they are squashed in a pressurized chamber, they heat up; when the pressure is released, they cool down and thus cool the air around them. The cooling capacity of these crystals is similar to that of the commercial refrigerants used in ACs, according to Moya.</p>\\n<p>If the concept works out, such a device could also be used for heating purposes by repeatedly squashing the crystals and thus heating them. &ldquo;At the moment, we are working on developing the next generation of prototypes, to have something that delivers on all aspects of cooling and heating powers and efficiencies,&rdquo; says Moya.</p>\\n<p>Other companies are focusing their efforts not on creating new refrigerants, but rather on designing altogether different methods of cooling&mdash;for instance, by sending excess heat to space. A Silicon Valley startup called SkyCool has developed rooftop panels that look like solar panels at first glance. They are, however, not meant to harness the energy of the sun&mdash;quite the opposite.</p>\\n<p>Every building, object or person on Earth radiates heat, which is absorbed by the atmosphere. However, radiation between eight and 13 micrometers in wavelength is not captured by the atmosphere: it simply passes through and escapes into space. Materials that radiate in that range can expel excess heat and cool themselves in the process in a phenomenon called passive radiative cooling.</p>\\n<p>SkyCool has collaborated with the manufacturing conglomerate 3M to develop an optical film that can do just that. SkyCool&rsquo;s panels are covered with this film and stay up to eight degrees Celsius cooler than the air around them, even under direct sunlight. In fact, the panels work best in hot and dry climates. When it&rsquo;s cloudy or humid, water vapour can trap the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03911-8\">radiation in the atmosphere</a>.</p>\\n<p>Beneath the film is a grid of pipes filled with a water-glycol mixture, which cools down when exposed to the panels&rsquo; colder temperature. The fluid is then pumped into a building\\'s air conditioning system to chill down the conventional refrigerants. In this way, the amount of electricity needed to keep these systems running can be reduced. A supermarket in California installed an early version of the high-tech panels in late 2019 and is now using 15 percent less electricity.</p>\\n<p>SkyCool co-founder and CEO Eli Goldstein says that the startup is focusing on commercial and industrial facilities for now, because they tend to have higher cooling loads. &ldquo;They run refrigeration systems, they have data centres, they have processes that need to be cooled, not just in the summer, but also the year round,&rdquo; he says. The IEA <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks\">estimates that 2 percent of all global electricity</a> is used by data centres and transferring networks.</p>\\n<p>This year, SkyCool has installed panels on a handful of supermarkets, data centres and a dining hall. The biggest obstacle to rolling out the technology nationwide, or even internationally, are the relatively high installation costs. SkyCool doesn&rsquo;t disclose its pricing but says that it charges slightly more than what it costs to install solar panels in the commercial sector (in the U.S. commercial rooftop panels are <a data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/new-reports-from-nrel-document-continuing-pv-and-pv-plus-storage-cost-declines.html&quot;}\" data-offer-url=\"https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/new-reports-from-nrel-document-continuing-pv-and-pv-plus-storage-cost-declines.html\" href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/new-reports-from-nrel-document-continuing-pv-and-pv-plus-storage-cost-declines.html\">benchmarked at $1.56 per watt</a>). The $3.5 million awarded by the Department of Energy in February 2021 could give the startup the push it needs to make the technology affordable and bring it to a larger market.</p>\\n<p>It is unlikely, though, that we will be seeing the panels on the roofs of residential buildings anytime soon. California-based startup Gradient is betting on heat pumps&rsquo; potential to decarbonise domestic cooling with high efficiency but low cost. The company has designed an electric pump, with two box-like components&mdash;one inside and one outside&mdash;connected by a platform that lies across the base of a window. It has heating and cooling functions.</p>\\n<p>Gradient uses a less potent refrigerant than the standard R-410A for its pump, which will be available in the U.S. before the summer of 2022. In the future the startup wants to use propane, which has even lower global warming potential than commonly used refrigerants. Propane is, however, more flammable and thus heavily regulated.</p>\\n<p>Heat pumps will not be completely carbon-free so long as the electricity comes from natural gas, oil or coal. &ldquo;The goal is that these systems use as much renewable electricity as possible, as soon as possible,&rdquo; says Gradient&rsquo;s head of engineering, Santhi Analytis. That would be a good start to ensure that cooling does not heat the planet.</p>\\n<p>Reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will require innovative solutions at a global scale.

But since the 2000s demand for air conditioning, ventilation and refrigeration systems has grown twice as fast as that for heating systems, at an average four percent per year.\\nGlobally, there are around two billion AC units in use today—with the United States, Japan and China accounting for two thirds of them. China produces about 70 per cent of the world’s air conditioners and has experienced exceptionally growing demand in the last twenty years; around four in ten air conditioners are purchased and installed in the country.\\nThe units precisely control the temperature and humidity in shops, laboratories or server rooms. They ensure that people feel as comfortable on a transatlantic flight as they do at home, using more electricity than any home appliance. But all that comes at a cost, and unless we switch to fully renewable electricity, the boom in air conditioning will generate more emissions and contribute to global warming, making hot summers even hotter.\\nWith every new AC installed, the risk of a leak increases. The technology behind modern ACs hasn’t changed significantly since 1902, when a 25-year-old engineer named Willis Carrier invented a mechanical unit to control the temperature and humidity in a printing plant in New York. Carrier’s unit sent air through coils filled with cold water, and cooled the air while removing moisture from the room. His invention was soon fitted in other buildings, mainly in the textile, film and food industries, and a few decades later in people’s homes.\\nToday, the coils are filled with a refrigerant, a cold substance that easily changes from liquid to gas because of its low boiling point. As warm air from a room passes over the evaporator coils, the refrigerant absorbs the ambient heat, evaporates and carries away the heat through a condenser unit that sits outside a building.\\nThese refrigerants are useful but problematic. They can seep out through joints, cracks or holes in the piping and contribute to global warming. The leakage of so-called fluorinated gases was particularly high by 2014—it accounted for about three percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe—so the EU adopted a law to cap the amounts of gases sold. The conventional refrigerant R-410A is still widely used worldwide and has the potential to trap thousands of times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.\\nWhile there are climate-friendlier AC units available on the market, most consumers purchase models that are cheaper and less efficient. In 2018, the Rocky Mountain Institute—a U.S. think tank focused on energy policy—offered a $1 million prize for residential cooling solutions that have a five times lower climate impact than a standard air conditioner, at no more than twice the cost. The prize, announced in April this year, went to two of the world’s largest manufacturers, Daikin and Gree. Their prototypes fundamentally work like existing ACs, but use refrigerants with lower global warming potential and are able to switch between operating modes depending on the outside weather conditions. Gree has also attached a small solar panel to its outdoor unit to generate some of the electricity needed to operate the AC.\\nBut other companies want to ditch gaseous refrigerants altogether and replace them with materials that absorb heat just as well without the risk of leakage or fire. Barocal, a spin-off from the University of Cambridge, was one of the eight finalists in the competition. The team behind it, led by material scientist Xavier Moya, investigated whether solid materials could efficiently cool air. It settled on plastic crystals to generate an effect known as barocaloric cooling: the crystals are flexible so when they are squashed in a pressurized chamber, they heat up; when the pressure is released, they cool down and thus cool the air around them. The cooling capacity of these crystals is similar to that of the commercial refrigerants used in ACs, according to Moya.\\nIf the concept works out, such a device could also be used for heating purposes by repeatedly squashing the crystals and thus heating them. “At the moment, we are working on developing the next generation of prototypes, to have something that delivers on all aspects of cooling and heating powers and efficiencies,” says Moya.\\nOther companies are focusing their efforts not on creating new refrigerants, but rather on designing altogether different methods of cooling—for instance, by sending excess heat to space. A Silicon Valley startup called SkyCool has developed rooftop panels that look like solar panels at first glance. They are, however, not meant to harness the energy of the sun—quite the opposite.\\nEvery building, object or person on Earth radiates heat, which is absorbed by the atmosphere. However, radiation between eight and 13 micrometers in wavelength is not captured by the atmosphere: it simply passes through and escapes into space. Materials that radiate in that range can expel excess heat and cool themselves in the process in a phenomenon called passive radiative cooling.\\nSkyCool has collaborated with the manufacturing conglomerate 3M to develop an optical film that can do just that.

      "There is an insidious irony to climate change: as it gets hotter, more and more people are cranking up their air conditioners, which in turn contributes to global warming.

Such facilities are becoming more commonplace as record-breaking heatwaves strike with increasingly regularity.Kathryn Elsesser/AFP via Getty Images\\nThere is an insidious irony to climate change: as it gets hotter, more and more people are cranking up their air conditioners, which in turn contributes to global warming. Air conditioner (AC) sales are booming worldwide, especially in emerging economies such as China, India and Indonesia where rising incomes make them more affordable and a warmer, more humid climate a necessity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that around two thirds of the world’s households could have an AC by 2050, and the demand for energy to cool buildings could triple.\\nKeeping buildings cool contributes to global warming in two ways: ACs run on electricity, and they can release chemicals with a strong heat-trapping effect. ACs account for 16 percent of total electricity used in residential and commercial buildings around the world. This is significantly less than emissions caused by heating buildings—heaters run on natural gas, oil or electricity. But since the 2000s demand for air conditioning, ventilation and refrigeration systems has grown twice as fast as that for heating systems, at an average four percent per year.\\nGlobally, there are around two billion AC units in use today—with the United States, Japan and China accounting for two thirds of them. China produces about 70 per cent of the world’s air conditioners and has experienced exceptionally growing demand in the last twenty years; around four in ten air conditioners are purchased and installed in the country.\\nThe units precisely control the temperature and humidity in shops, laboratories or server rooms. They ensure that people feel as comfortable on a transatlantic flight as they do at home, using more electricity than any home appliance. But all that comes at a cost, and unless we switch to fully renewable electricity, the boom in air conditioning will generate more emissions and contribute to global warming, making hot summers even hotter.\\nWith every new AC installed, the risk of a leak increases. The technology behind modern ACs hasn’t changed significantly since 1902, when a 25-year-old engineer named Willis Carrier invented a mechanical unit to control the temperature and humidity in a printing plant in New York. Carrier’s unit sent air through coils filled with cold water, and cooled the air while removing moisture from the room. His invention was soon fitted in other buildings, mainly in the textile, film and food industries, and a few decades later in people’s homes.\\nToday, the coils are filled with a refrigerant, a cold substance that easily changes from liquid to gas because of its low boiling point. As warm air from a room passes over the evaporator coils, the refrigerant absorbs the ambient heat, evaporates and carries away the heat through a condenser unit that sits outside a building.\\nThese refrigerants are useful but problematic. They can seep out through joints, cracks or holes in the piping and contribute to global warming. The leakage of so-called fluorinated gases was particularly high by 2014—it accounted for about three percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe—so the EU adopted a law to cap the amounts of gases sold. The conventional refrigerant R-410A is still widely used worldwide and has the potential to trap thousands of times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.\\nWhile there are climate-friendlier AC units available on the market, most consumers purchase models that are cheaper and less efficient. In 2018, the Rocky Mountain Institute—a U.S. think tank focused on energy policy—offered a $1 million prize for residential cooling solutions that have a five times lower climate impact than a standard air conditioner, at no more than twice the cost. The prize, announced in April this year, went to two of the world’s largest manufacturers, Daikin and Gree. Their prototypes fundamentally work like existing ACs, but use refrigerants with lower global warming potential and are able to switch between operating modes depending on the outside weather conditions. Gree has also attached a small solar panel to its outdoor unit to generate some of the electricity needed to operate the AC.\\nBut other companies want to ditch gaseous refrigerants altogether and replace them with materials that absorb heat just as well without the risk of leakage or fire. Barocal, a spin-off from the University of Cambridge, was one of the eight finalists in the competition. The team behind it, led by material scientist Xavier Moya, investigated whether solid materials could efficiently cool air. It settled on plastic crystals to generate an effect known as barocaloric cooling: the crystals are flexible so when they are squashed in a pressurized chamber, they heat up; when the pressure is released, they cool down and thus cool the air around them. The cooling capacity of these crystals is similar to that of the commercial refrigerants used in ACs, according to Moya.\\nIf the concept works out, such a device could also be used for heating purposes by repeatedly squashing the crystals and thus heating them. “At the moment, we are working on developing the next generation of prototypes, to have something that delivers on all aspects of cooling and heating powers and efficiencies,” says Moya.\\nOther companies are focusing their efforts not on creating new refrigerants, but rather on designing altogether different methods of cooling—for instance, by sending excess heat to space. A Silicon Valley startup called SkyCool has developed rooftop panels that look like solar panels at first glance. They are, however, not meant to harness the energy of the sun—quite the opposite.\\nEvery building, object or person on Earth radiates heat, which is absorbed by the atmosphere. However, radiation between eight and 13 micrometers in wavelength is not captured by the atmosphere: it simply passes through and escapes into space. Materials that radiate in that range can expel excess heat and cool themselves in the process in a phenomenon called passive radiative cooling.\\nSkyCool has collaborated with the manufacturing conglomerate 3M to develop an optical film that can do just that. SkyCool’s panels are covered with this film and stay up to eight degrees Celsius cooler than the air around them, even under direct sunlight. In fact, the panels work best in hot and dry climates. When it’s cloudy or humid, water vapour can trap the radiation in the atmosphere.\\nBeneath the film is a grid of pipes filled with a water-glycol mixture, which cools down when exposed to the panels’ colder temperature. The fluid is then pumped into a building's air conditioning system to chill down the conventional refrigerants. In this way, the amount of electricity needed to keep these systems running can be reduced. A supermarket in California installed an early version of the high-tech panels in late 2019 and is now using 15 percent less electricity.\\nSkyCool co-founder and CEO Eli Goldstein says that the startup is focusing on commercial and industrial facilities for now, because they tend to have higher cooling loads. “They run refrigeration systems, they have data centres, they have processes that need to be cooled, not just in the summer, but also the year round,” he says.

But while she&rsquo;s been reviewing laptops, desktops, and PC hardware for her entire career, she is also going to report on broadband and education. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m particularly excited to start reporting on the latter two,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;because that&rsquo;s what I used to cover when I wrote for <em>Gizmodo</em> and ended up falling in love with those beats.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>In fact, Joanna&rsquo;s background is in creative writing, literature, and teaching. &ldquo;But with the current chaos surrounding generative AI,&rdquo; she explains, &ldquo;and the push for more tech courses, including digital media literacy in cash-strapped schools, it feels like I&rsquo;m in the right place at the right time.&rdquo; She is also working on a memoir and several short stories.</p>\\n<p>Here, Joanna discusses her use of today&rsquo;s technology, her fondness for yesterday&rsquo;s, and how her family&rsquo;s past has influenced her present.</p>\\n<p><em>You can tell a lot about a person by examining their book collection.</em></p>\\n<h3>That&rsquo;s a nice space. Where in your home is it?</h3>\\n<p>Downstairs and off the main hallway, where most of the other rooms are located. My partner and I decided to move in together recently, and we settled here because it had enough space for us to each have our own office. We both work from home, are in and out of meetings all the time, and do creative work that requires a lot of focus, so separate workspaces were on our list of requirements before we even started looking at places.</p>\\n<p>All of the furniture in my office came from my old place. I insisted on keeping my living room couch because it wasn&rsquo;t cheap, but I also really wanted an office space that felt similar to some of my college and grad school professors&rsquo; offices. Theirs were cozy and filled with the smell of old books, worn leather furniture, and photocopied reading packets. I&rsquo;m getting nostalgic just thinking about them.</p>\\n<h3>Tell us about your desk. </h3>\\n<p>I love antiques, things that scream early 20th century, especially if they feel like they could have come from a school. Mine is a three-piece from World Market, and it&rsquo;s about as utilitarian as you can get for a work desk: heavy, thick wood for the surface, and painted, slightly distressed metal for the storage. I&rsquo;m glad I opted for one side to have open shelves instead of two sets of drawers, though. Like a lot of early 20th-century furniture, the drawers don&rsquo;t have tracks, so it&rsquo;s just metal rubbing on metal and doesn&rsquo;t always sound great &mdash; but I love this desk and don&rsquo;t see myself getting rid of it anytime soon, if ever.</p>\\n<h3>And your chair?</h3>\\n<p>My swivel chair is also from World Market, and I bought it at the same time as the desk (years ago, and both are now discontinued). There were other color choices, but I went with this one because I thought it fit the best into the vibe I was trying to create.</p>\\n<p>In retrospect, I should have gone with a darker color. No matter how often I take a scrub brush to my chair, I can&rsquo;t make it look like new again. It was also a lot more comfortable when I first bought it, but after several years of remote work, I can sometimes feel a spring poking me in the butt. I probably should buy a new one, but overall, it&rsquo;s truly been the most comfortable swivel chair I&rsquo;ve owned.</p>\\n<p>It&rsquo;s also forced me to have good sitting posture, which is crucial when you sit at a computer all day! You&rsquo;d think high-backed office chairs would do that for me, but I&rsquo;m much shorter than the average person, so all they&rsquo;ve done for me is give me neck and shoulder pain to complain about.</p>\\n<p><em>Sometimes a good working environment means a comfortable group of familiar objects.</em></p>\\n<h3>Here&rsquo;s the big one: tell us about the tech you&rsquo;re using. </h3>\\n<p>Speaking of aches and pains &mdash; my partner gave me his <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/4/20848369/logitech-mx-master-3-keys-best-mouse-even-better-magnetic-scroll-wheel\">Logitech MX Master 3</a> mouse because the gaming mouse I was using before (and the three gaming mice before that) started giving me wrist pains. My pinky would lock up sometimes, too.</p>\\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have any of those issues with the MX Master 3. It&rsquo;s ergonomically designed to keep your wrist in a natural position, and even though it&rsquo;s such a small adjustment compared to how my wrist is positioned with a standard gaming mouse, it was enough to completely get rid of the pain. Now, I use this mouse for everything, even gaming.</p>\\n<p>My keyboard is the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnuphy.com%2Fproducts%2Fair75-v2&xcust=___vg__p_23870849__t_w__d_D\">Nuphy Air75 V2</a> with low profile keys and the company&rsquo;s own Cowberry linear mechanical switches. I can see why Nuphy named this specific mechanical keyboard line &ldquo;Air,&rdquo; because it does feel like you are typing on air. The keys require little actuation force, and they make a pleasant and light thunk sound when they bottom out &mdash; even the spacebar, which has some of the best key stabilizers I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a keyboard. I&rsquo;ve used too many mechanical keyboards with wobbly, pingy spacebars.</p>\\n<h3><a data-item-id=\"N84hKm\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnuphy.com%2Fproducts%2Fair75-v2&xcust=___vg__p_23870849__i_N84hKm__t_w__d_D\">NuPhy Air75 V2 wireless mechanical keyboard</a></h3>\\n<p>$120</p>\\n<p>Excellent QMK / VIA wireless mechanical keyboard.</p>\\n<p><a data-item-id=\"N84hKm\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnuphy.com%2Fproducts%2Fair75-v2&xcust=___vg__p_23870849__i_N84hKm__t_w__d_D\">$120 at NuPhy</a></p>\\n<p>The keyboard&rsquo;s translucent panel goes hard on the &rsquo;90s vibes, too, and makes me nostalgic for the green VTech cordless home phone I had in high school. Should this keyboard ever give me the same wrist problems as gaming mice, I will cry. It&rsquo;s the best keyboard I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>\\n<p>It might look like there are three displays on my desk, but the two little displays are part of a dual-screen laptop, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23794761/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-review\">Lenovo Yoga Book 9i</a>. My main machine used to be a gaming desktop that I built, paired with the same <a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/M28U#kf\">Gigabyte M28U</a> display and another monitor, but after reviewing GPUs and CPUs plus laptops for so many years, all that hardware overwhelmed my workspace. I tried just using one monitor for a while, but it wasn&rsquo;t as convenient for managing multiple windows.

(I do love <em>Friday the 13th</em>, though!) The cel is an original from the animated <em>Beetlejuice</em> series.

In college, I was heavily involved in black-and-white film photography, from developing the negatives myself to making my own prints. I spent more time in a dark room than I did in my dorm room. But I knew very little about my great-uncle back then, beyond that he was a photographer at some point during his life.

She’s worked as an editor and writer for almost 40 years. Previously, she was a senior reviews editor for Computerworld.\\nShare this story\\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\\nJoanna Nelius is a recent addition to The Verge’s staff, having joined us a little over a month ago to become our new laptop reviewer. But while she’s been reviewing laptops, desktops, and PC hardware for her entire career, she is also going to report on broadband and education. “I’m particularly excited to start reporting on the latter two,” she says, “because that’s what I used to cover when I wrote for Gizmodo and ended up falling in love with those beats.”\\nIn fact, Joanna’s background is in creative writing, literature, and teaching. “But with the current chaos surrounding generative AI,” she explains, “and the push for more tech courses, including digital media literacy in cash-strapped schools, it feels like I’m in the right place at the right time.” She is also working on a memoir and several short stories.\\nHere, Joanna discusses her use of today’s technology, her fondness for yesterday’s, and how her family’s past has influenced her present.\\nThat’s a nice space. Where in your home is it?\\nDownstairs and off the main hallway, where most of the other rooms are located. My partner and I decided to move in together recently, and we settled here because it had enough space for us to each have our own office. We both work from home, are in and out of meetings all the time, and do creative work that requires a lot of focus, so separate workspaces were on our list of requirements before we even started looking at places.\\nAll of the furniture in my office came from my old place. I insisted on keeping my living room couch because it wasn’t cheap, but I also really wanted an office space that felt similar to some of my college and grad school professors’ offices. Theirs were cozy and filled with the smell of old books, worn leather furniture, and photocopied reading packets. I’m getting nostalgic just thinking about them.\\nTell us about your desk.\\nI love antiques, things that scream early 20th century, especially if they feel like they could have come from a school. Mine is a three-piece from World Market, and it’s about as utilitarian as you can get for a work desk: heavy, thick wood for the surface, and painted, slightly distressed metal for the storage. I’m glad I opted for one side to have open shelves instead of two sets of drawers, though. Like a lot of early 20th-century furniture, the drawers don’t have tracks, so it’s just metal rubbing on metal and doesn’t always sound great — but I love this desk and don’t see myself getting rid of it anytime soon, if ever.\\nAnd your chair?\\nMy swivel chair is also from World Market, and I bought it at the same time as the desk (years ago, and both are now discontinued). There were other color choices, but I went with this one because I thought it fit the best into the vibe I was trying to create.\\nIn retrospect, I should have gone with a darker color. No matter how often I take a scrub brush to my chair, I can’t make it look like new again. It was also a lot more comfortable when I first bought it, but after several years of remote work, I can sometimes feel a spring poking me in the butt. I probably should buy a new one, but overall, it’s truly been the most comfortable swivel chair I’ve owned.\\nIt’s also forced me to have good sitting posture, which is crucial when you sit at a computer all day! You’d think high-backed office chairs would do that for me, but I’m much shorter than the average person, so all they’ve done for me is give me neck and shoulder pain to complain about.\\nHere’s the big one: tell us about the tech you’re using.\\nSpeaking of aches and pains — my partner gave me his Logitech MX Master 3 mouse because the gaming mouse I was using before (and the three gaming mice before that) started giving me wrist pains. My pinky would lock up sometimes, too.\\nI don’t have any of those issues with the MX Master 3. It’s ergonomically designed to keep your wrist in a natural position, and even though it’s such a small adjustment compared to how my wrist is positioned with a standard gaming mouse, it was enough to completely get rid of the pain. Now, I use this mouse for everything, even gaming.\\nMy keyboard is the Nuphy Air75 V2 with low profile keys and the company’s own Cowberry linear mechanical switches. I can see why Nuphy named this specific mechanical keyboard line “Air,” because it does feel like you are typing on air. The keys require little actuation force, and they make a pleasant and light thunk sound when they bottom out — even the spacebar, which has some of the best key stabilizers I’ve ever seen on a keyboard. I’ve used too many mechanical keyboards with wobbly, pingy spacebars.\\nNuPhy Air75 V2 wireless mechanical keyboard\\n$120\\nExcellent QMK / VIA wireless mechanical keyboard.\\n$120 at NuPhy\\nThe keyboard’s translucent panel goes hard on the ’90s vibes, too, and makes me nostalgic for the green VTech cordless home phone I had in high school. Should this keyboard ever give me the same wrist problems as gaming mice, I will cry. It’s the best keyboard I’ve ever used.\\nIt might look like there are three displays on my desk, but the two little displays are part of a dual-screen laptop, the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. My main machine used to be a gaming desktop that I built, paired with the same Gigabyte M28U display and another monitor, but after reviewing GPUs and CPUs plus laptops for so many years, all that hardware overwhelmed my workspace. I tried just using one monitor for a while, but it wasn’t as convenient for managing multiple windows. My workflow broke.\\nThen, Lenovo came out with its Yoga Book 9i, which solved both my space and workflow issues instantly. The dual display was one reason and the Thunderbolt 4 ports were another.

One day I’ll figure it out.\n",
      "Are there any stories behind the pictures above your desk?\n",
      "Only the black-and-white one in the middle and the cel animation sheet on the right. (I do love Friday the 13th, though!) The cel is an original from the animated Beetlejuice series. I found it at a collectibles shop near old town Vegas, within walking distance from (if I’m remembering correctly) the Four Queens with a generous Big Lebowski slot machine that funded my shopping trip.\n",
      "The black-and-white landscape photo is one of my great-uncle’s original prints. In college, I was heavily involved in black-and-white film photography, from developing the negatives myself to making my own prints. I spent more time in a dark room than I did in my dorm room. But I knew very little about my great-uncle back then, beyond that he was a photographer at some point during his life. I only met the man once when I was a kid, and the only thing I remember about him was that he was grumpy, and he and my grandma didn’t seem to get along.\n",
      "Some years after I graduated college, my great-uncle passed away, and to my surprise, that original print showed up in the mail. My grandmother did talk to her sister-in-law on a regular basis and mentioned me getting into photography, because my great-aunt was not only insistent on giving it to me but also took the opportunity to tell me about his career as a photographer.\n",
      "The man was a Guggenheim fellow. He taught graduate seminars and photographed ancient coins for the American Numismatic Society. His work was published in books alongside the work of Minor White and Ansel Adams. I’m not sure if the MoMA still keeps some of his original prints in its collection, but his work was part of its collection back when my great-aunt sent me that print.\n",
      "At that point in my life, I was the only one in my family (and much of my extended family) who did anything creative, so I felt like I didn’t belong. But learning all of that about my great-uncle changed everything. It was the encouragement I needed to keep pursuing a career as a writer. I probably wouldn’t be writing this if it weren’t for that photograph.\n",
